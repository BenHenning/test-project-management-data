## Overview

#### Project Description
_A clear description of what the project's problem statement and what it will accomplish. See [examples](https://github.com/BenHenning/test-project-management-data/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+PTI%22+) for help filling out this template._

## Leads

#### Project Lead
_@-mentioned GitHub name of the person leading this project._

#### Technical Lead
_@-mentioned GitHub name of the person leading the technical aspects of this project. May be the same as the project lead if there is no dedicated technical lead._

#### Product Managers
_@-mentioned GitHub name of the person, or list of names of the people defining the product specification for this project. May be the same as the project lead if there are no dedicated product managers._

## Timeline

#### Estimated Start Date
_The estimate date this project will start in the format: YYYY-MM-DD. Dates are assumed to be corresponding to midnight GMT of the date specified. This can change if project priorities shift, but it shouldn't be changed to match the actual start date._

#### Actual Start Date
_The actual date that this project has started in the format: YYYY-MM-DD. This should never be in the future._

#3## Estimated Duration
_The numerical estimate, in weeks, that this project will require before it's completed. The end date is presumed to be the start date plus this estimate, so this should account for any parallelization or breaks needed in the project._

#### Breakdown
_This section contains a piecewise break-down of the project including estimates for each stage of the project, the milestones, and the expected completion work amount for each milestone. This list may start initially with 'TBDs' but it should be filled in as estimates are known, and before those tasks are started. Estimates are in weeks or days._
